## 📝 How to Run Backend

```bash
# Navigate to backend
cd backend

# Run server
python manage.py runserver

# Backend API will be at: http://localhost:8000
# Django Admin: http://localhost:8000/admin
```

## 🔑 Create Superuser

```bash
cd backend
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## 📊 Sample Data Creation
